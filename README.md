# FEM_elastic-deformation
Program for counting elastic deformation utilizes FEM numerical techniques to simulate and analyze structural behavior.

## Program 
Program solves two given problems, where:
- Orange serie : solution of first problem
- Green series : solution of second problem
  
With incrementation of the number of elements, the results are more accurate.
